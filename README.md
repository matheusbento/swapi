# SWAPI

Consuming the SWApi with Next.JS filtering by Character that has Brown Hair

### How to run

- Clone the project
- Run `yarn install` or `npm install`
- Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

Project URL: http://localhost:3000

### Problem and Thoughts

1 - SWApi doesn't provide an API to get all Characters at the same time, I need to implement a batch function to get characters from all pages so that it will run approximately 9 pages.

2 - I also need to do a batch function to get each Homeworld from the characters
